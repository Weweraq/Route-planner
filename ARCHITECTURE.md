# Route Planner Application Architecture

This document describes the technical architecture of the Route Planner application, intended for developers who need to understand, maintain, or extend the codebase.

## Architecture Overview

The Route Planner follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Presentation  │  Flask routes, HTML/CSS/JS frontend
├─────────────────┤
│  Business Logic │  Route planning, data processing
├─────────────────┤
│   Data Access   │  Google Maps API client, database
└─────────────────┘
```

## Component Structure

### Backend Components

1. **Flask Application** (`app.py`)
   - Application factory pattern
   - Configuration loading
   - Blueprint registration

2. **Routes** (`routes.py`)
   - API endpoints
   - Request handling
   - Response formatting

3. **Business Logic** (`business/route_planner.py`)
   - Route calculation logic
   - Data transformation
   - Business rules implementation

4. **Data Access** (`data/google_maps_client.py`, `db.py`)
   - Google Maps API integration
   - Database operations
   - External service communication

5. **Configuration** (`config.py`)
   - Environment-specific settings
   - API keys management
   - Application parameters

### Frontend Components

1. **Main Application** (`static/js/app.js`)
   - Application initialization
   - Component coordination

2. **UI Controller** (`static/js/ui-controller.js`)
   - User interaction handling
   - DOM manipulation
   - Event listeners

3. **Map Manager** (`static/js/map-manager.js`)
   - Google Maps integration
   - Map rendering
   - Route visualization

4. **Route Service** (`static/js/route-service.js`)
   - API communication
   - Route data handling
   - Caching

5. **Utilities** (`static/js/utils.js`)
   - Helper functions
   - Formatting utilities
   - Common operations

## Data Flow

### Route Planning Flow

1. User enters route information in the UI
2. UI Controller collects and validates input
3. Route Service sends request to backend API
4. Routes blueprint processes the request
5. Route Planner business logic processes the data
6. Google Maps Client fetches route information from Google API
7. Route Planner transforms and enhances the data
8. Data flows back through the layers to the UI
9. Map Manager visualizes the route on the map
10. UI Controller displays route details in the sidebar

```
User → UI Controller → Route Service → Flask Routes → Route Planner → Google Maps Client → Google API
  ↑                                                                                              ↓
  └──────────── Map Manager ← UI Controller ← Route Details ← Processed Route Data ←─────────────┘
```

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Factory Pattern**
   - Application factory in `app.py`
   - Configuration factory in `config.py`

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Components receive dependencies through constructors
   - Facilitates testing and flexibility

3. **Repository Pattern**
   - Data access abstraction in `db.py`
   - Separates business logic from data storage

4. **Service Layer**
   - Route planning service in `business/route_planner.py`
   - Encapsulates business logic

5. **Module Pattern (JavaScript)**
   - Frontend components organized as modules
   - Clear separation of responsibilities

## Configuration Management

The application uses a hierarchical configuration system:

1. **Default Values**
   - Hardcoded defaults as fallbacks

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Loaded from `.env` file
   - Override defaults

3. **Environment-Specific Configs**
   - Development and production configurations
   - Inherit from base config

## API Integration

### Google Maps API

The application integrates with several Google Maps APIs:

1. **Directions API**
   - Used for route calculation
   - Traffic information
   - Distance and duration estimates

2. **Places API**
   - Address autocomplete
   - Geocoding

3. **Maps JavaScript API**
   - Interactive map display
   - Route visualization
   - Marker management

## Database Design

The application uses SQLite for data storage:

1. **Places Table**
   - Stores location information
   - Used for predefined locations

2. **Edges Table**
   - Represents connections between places
   - Stores distance and time information

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Management**
   - API keys stored in environment variables
   - Not hardcoded in source code

2. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs validated before processing
   - Length limits on address inputs

3. **Error Handling**
   - Structured error responses
   - No sensitive information in error messages

## Extensibility Points

The application is designed to be extended in several ways:

1. **Additional Route Options**
   - New route calculation modes can be added to `route_planner.py`

2. **Alternative Map Providers**
   - The Map Manager can be extended to support other mapping services

3. **Additional Export Formats**
   - New export formats can be added to the Export Manager

4. **Authentication System**
   - The application can be extended with user authentication

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Located in `test_*.py` files

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interaction between components
   - Focus on API endpoints

3. **Manual Testing**
   - UI functionality
   - Map interaction

## Deployment Options

The application supports multiple deployment methods:

1. **Standard Deployment**
   - Run directly with Python

2. **Docker Deployment**
   - Containerized with Docker
   - Orchestrated with Docker Compose

3. **Package Deployment**
   - Installed as a Python package

## Performance Considerations

1. **Caching**
   - Route results are cached to reduce API calls
   - Cache is managed by the Cache Manager

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - Map resources are loaded on demand

3. **Optimized API Requests**
   - Batched geocoding requests
   - Minimal data transfer

## Future Architectural Improvements

1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Split into smaller, focused services

2. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Background processing for long-running tasks

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket integration for live traffic updates

4. **Expanded Database**
   - More sophisticated data storage for routes and user preferences
